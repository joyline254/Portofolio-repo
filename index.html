					                  WHY PROGRAMMING
				              	To begin with programming is a hands on skill thing.Well it fascinates
				              	at how one can be sitting behind a machine and come up on something that 
				              	can be worked on.                         
					          	  Am currently working on deepening my knowledge on software development
				              	To become part of developers and grow towards a skilled if not expertise.
